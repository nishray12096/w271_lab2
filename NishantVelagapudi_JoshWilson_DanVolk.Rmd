## Read in Data

```{r results='hide', echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

pkg <- c('car', 'plyr', 'ggplot2', 'Hmisc', 'stargazer',
         'ggpubr', 'gridExtra', 'wesanderson', 'MASS')

lapply(pkg, require, character.only = T)

## Variable Dictionary
First, we define each of the variables within our dataset.
*id*: identifier of survey respondant
*studyday*:
*dayweek*: day of week (saturday == 6)
*numall*: number of alcoholic beverages consumed on that day
*nrel*: negative romantic relationship event
*prel*: positive romantic relatinship event
*negevent*: number & intensity of negative events in a day (0-3)
*posevent*: number & intensity of positive events in a day (0-3)
*gender*: male (1) female (2)
*rosn*: trait self-esteem
*age*:
*desired*: desire to drink each day, higher number corresponds to more desire
*state*: short-term self-esteem state

## Restricting Data to Mimic Example in Textbook

The data was collected over a 30 day period. We therefore have multiple data points for the same people. This repeated measures data structure will be sidestepped by focusing on the first Saturday for all subjects.
```{r}
# Reducing data to first Saturday following the texbook methodology
df_sat <- data_c[data_c$dayweek == 6,]
```


## Missing Value Investigation
We start by investigating whether or not we are missing any datapoints:
```{r}
data_c[which(complete.cases(data_c) == F),]

data <- data_c[complete.cases(data_c),]

```
We find there are 5 instances of missing data: which is surprising for a study that relies on self-reporting, as we would expect many more missing entries. We see some cases are missing the desired drinks variable or the number of alcholic beverages consumed. We will likely exclude these data points. Given that there are only 5 observations with missing data (out of 623 total) and often these observations are missing the response variables ("Numall" and "desired"), we will not impute missing values and instead exclude these data.

## Check for violations of the assumption of independence
We are concerned that there is strong dependence in this data. We see that each survey respondent corresponds to several days of responses: it seems possible that variables from a previous day may affect the desire to drink or number of drinks consumed the following day. We will investigate whether or not assuming independence between each observation is appropriate here.

## Univariate Analysis
We next investigate and visualize individual variables.
```{r}
summary(data)

par(mfrow=c(1,3))

#Variables of immediate interest: rosn = self-worth, nrel=negative relationship interactions, desired = desire to drink
#We see that Id identifies a single respondant: each respondant has 7 responses (one for each day of the week)
ggplot(data = data, aes(x = numall)) + geom_histogram() + stat_bin(bins = 20)
ggplot(data = data, aes(x = nrel)) + geom_histogram()
ggplot(data = data, aes(x = desired)) + geom_histogram()
ggplot(data = data, aes(x = rosn)) + geom_histogram()

dplyr::count(data, id)

#We see a skewed response distribution by gender
dplyr::count(data, gender)
```
We see that the number of drinks variable is right skewed - most of the data is 4 or below. We will watch to see if outliers are unduly influencing any models developed. The Nrel variable likely needs to be bucketed or even binarized. The vast majority of observations have an Nrel of 0. The desire to drink variable is a bell-shaped, while the self worth variable is left skewed and has a large spike near the value of 3.5. We bucket each of these variables for potential use in bivariate analysis.

```{r}
# Plot of dependent variable vs poisson distribution
rel.freq <- table(data$numall)/length(data$numall)
rel.freq2 <- c(rel.freq, rep(0, times=7))
y <- 0:24
prob <- round(dpois(y, mean(data$numall)), 4)
plot(y-0.1, prob, type="h", ylab="Probability", xlab="# of Drinks", main="Observed Data vs Poisson")
axis(side=1, at=seq(0,24,2))
lines(y+0.1, y=rel.freq2, type="h", col='red')
legend(17,0.25, c("Poisson", "Observed"), col=c('black','red'), lty=c('solid','solid'), bty='n')
```

The comparison between the simulated Poisson distribution with a mean equal to that of our sample appears to be a relatively good fit. This makes sense as the number of drinks consumed - our dependent variable - is a count variable. One concern is that the zero might be inflated and we will have to take care when we model this as a poisson. Generally, we believe the dependent variable lends itself to Poisson regression analysis.

```{r}
#bucket data
data['nrelBucket'] <- transform(data, group=cut(as.numeric(sub('[%]', '', nrel+.001)), 
    breaks=c(0,1, 2, 3, 4,5,6,7,8.1),
    labels=c('0-1', '1-2', '2-3', '3-4', '4-5', '5-6','6-7','7-8')))$group

data['rosnBucket'] <- transform(data, group=cut(as.numeric(sub('[%]', '', rosn)), 
    breaks=c(2,2.5, 3, 3.5, 4),
    labels=c('2-2.5', '2.5-3', '3-3.5', '3.5-4')))$group

data['desiredBucket'] <- transform(data, group=cut(as.numeric(sub('[%]', '', desired+.001)), 
    breaks=c(0,1, 2, 3, 4,5,6,7,8.1),
    labels=c('0-1', '1-2', '2-3', '3-4', '4-5', '5-6','6-7','7-8')))$group

length(data[data$nrel > 0, "nrel"])
#146 observations actually have nrel > 0. This could lead to an overestimation of the effect of nrel, especially in cases where nrel is very high.
data['HasNrel'] = data$nrel > 0

```

Investigation of observation dependence leads to concerns that desire to drink is highly relative from respondent to respondent. Thus, we investigate normalizing the desire to drink by the average value observed from the respondent overall. This will change subsequent model interpretations: as we will be inferring how factors cause change to the respondent's usual desire to drink/number of drinks.
```{r}
#distribution of average desired by id
avgDrink <- data.frame(aggregate(desired ~ id, data, mean))
hist(avgDrink$desired)

#we can see that the average desire to drink is also a normal distribution. This suggests that when we are looking at a desire to drink, we might want to consider what that person's "baseline" drinking is

#we can do this by taking a desire to drink as a distance from average desire to drink

data = merge(data, avgDrink, by="id")
data = rename(data, c('desired.y' = 'Id_MeanDrink', 'desired.x' = 'desired'))
```
```{r}
data['desired_adj'] = data$desired - data$Id_MeanDrink
hist(data$desired_adj)

#this gives a normal distribution of desired

```

## Bivariate Analysis
We next look at investigating relationships between variables. First, we investigate how gender might vary with desire to drink and each of our identified explanatory variables of interest.
```{r}
#Split out three variables of interest by gender

biv_1 <- ggplot(data, aes(factor(gender), rosn)) + geom_boxplot(aes(fill=factor(gender))) +
         geom_jitter(width=0.1) + xlab("Gender")       + ggtitle("Self-worth")      +
         theme(plot.title=element_text(lineheight=1, face="bold"))

biv_2 <- ggplot(data, aes(factor(gender), negevent)) + geom_boxplot(aes(fill=factor(gender))) +
         geom_jitter(width=0.1) + xlab("negevent")       + ggtitle("Neg. Rel. Events")      +
         theme(plot.title=element_text(lineheight=1, face="bold"))

biv_3 <- ggplot(data, aes(factor(gender), desired)) + geom_boxplot(aes(fill=factor(gender))) +
         geom_jitter(width=0.1) + xlab("desired")       + ggtitle("Drinking Desire")      +
         theme(plot.title=element_text(lineheight=1, face="bold"))

ggarrange(biv_1, biv_2, biv_3, ncol=3, common.legend = TRUE, legend="bottom")
```

Our next series of plots asks a series of questions about relationships between each of our explanatory variables as well as our response variables.
```{r More EDA}

# Does  self esteem relate to desire to drink
ggplot(data = data, aes(x = rosn, y = desired)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth() + xlab("Self-Esteem") + ylab("Desire to Drink")

# Does Negative Romantic events relate to the desire to drink
ggplot(data = data, aes(x = nrel, y = desired)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth() + xlab("Negative Romantic Events") + ylab("Desire to Drink")

# Does Self-Esteem  relate to Total drink consumption
ggplot(data = data, aes(x = rosn, y = numall)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth() + xlab("Self-Esteem") + ylab("Total Drink Consumption")

# Looking At the Desire to Drink by Negative Events by Gender
ggplot(data = data, aes(x = rosn, y = desired, fill = as.factor(gender))) + geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth() + xlab("Self-Esteem") + ylab("Desire to Drink")

# Does self-esteem vary by gender?
ggplot(data = data, aes(x = as.factor(gender), y = rosn)) + geom_boxplot(aes(fill=factor(gender))) + geom_jitter(width=0.1)

# Does self-esteem vary by age
ggplot(data = data, aes(x = age, y = rosn)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth() + xlab("Age") + ylab("Self-Esteem")

# Numall by desire to drink, colorized by nrel binarized

ggplot(data = data, aes(x = desired, y = numall, colour = as.factor(HasNrel))) + 
  geom_point() + geom_smooth() + xlab("Total Drink Consumption") +
  ylab("Desire to Drink")

# Numall by desire to drink, colorized by self esteem

ggplot(data = data, aes(x = desired, y = numall, color = rosn)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_smooth() + xlab("Total Drink Consumption") +
  ylab("Desire to Drink")

# plot nrel versus rosn, colored by desire to drink
ggplot(data, aes(x=nrel, y=rosn,color=desired)) + geom_point()
```


We cross-tabulate our data to see how many observations fall into each bucket of negative relationship events, self worth values, and desire to drink values. 
```{r}
#volume and mean desire to drink in each bucket
dplyr::count(data, nrelBucket, rosnBucket, desiredBucket)

xtabs(desired ~ nrelBucket, aggregate(desired ~ nrelBucket, data, mean))
xtabs(desired ~ rosnBucket, aggregate(desired ~ rosnBucket, data, mean))

xtabs(desired ~ nrelBucket + rosnBucket, aggregate(desired ~ nrelBucket + rosnBucket, data, mean))
table(data$nrelBucket, data$rosnBucket)

```
We observe that desire to drink does appear to climb with negative relationship events, but there are so few observations with multiple negative relationship events that this finding cannot be taken at face value.

We focus on negative relationship events: splitting our desire to drink data into values where negative relationship events are more than zero or zero. Performing a wilcox rank-sum test informs us of whether or not there is a statistically significant average difference in desire to drink when the survey respondent has either no negative relationship events or some negative relationship events.
```{r}
data.frame(aggregate(desired ~ HasNrel, data, mean))
#little difference between 0 and nonzero here.
#test for significance of difference using wilcoxon rank sum test
#unaltered desired to drink - nonsignificant, closer to significance
wilcox.test(data[data$nrel > 0, "desired"], data[data$nrel == 0, "desired"])
#adjusted desire to drink - nonsignificant
wilcox.test(data[data$nrel > 0, "desired_adj"], data[data$nrel == 0, "desired_adj"])
```
We find that the difference is not significant: either when we test for desire to drink or desire to drink adjusted by the average desire to drink by respondant.

## Model Fitting

```{r}
mod <- glm(numall ~ nrel + rosn + nrel*rosn, family=poisson(link="log"), data=data)
summary(mod)
